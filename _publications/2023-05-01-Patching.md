title: "Patching Non-Uniform Extraordinary Points"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-05-01-Patching
excerpt: 'Smooth surfaces from an arbitrary topological control grid have been widely studied, which are mostly generalized from splines with uniform knot intervals. These methods fail to work well on extraordinary points (EPs) whose edges have varying knot intervals. This paper presents a patching solution for arbitrary topological 2-manifold control grid with non-uniform knots that defines one bi-cubic Bézier patch per control grid face except those faces with EPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the new solution can improve the surface quality for non-uniform parameterization. Applications in surface reconstruction, arbitrary sharp features on the complex surface and tool path planning for the new surface representation are also provided in the paper.'

Smooth surfaces from an arbitrary topological control grid have been widely studied, which are mostly generalized from splines with uniform knot intervals. These methods fail to work well on extraordinary points (EPs) whose edges have varying knot intervals. This paper presents a patching solution for arbitrary topological 2-manifold control grid with non-uniform knots that defines one bi-cubic Bézier patch per control grid face except those faces with EPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the new solution can improve the surface quality for non-uniform parameterization.
